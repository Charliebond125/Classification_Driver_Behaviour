# Classification_Driver_Behaviour

Using Classifier ML models to predict driver behaviour.

The steps taken will be as follows:

1. Importing required Libraries
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Feature Analysis
5. Dimensionality Reduction
6. Scaling, removing mean and standard deviation outliers
7. Cross Validation and KFold
8. Construction of pipelines
9. Feeding transformed data into pipes, visualizing results
10. Testing P value, F1 Score, and Model Accuracy
11. Testing against other classifier models
12. Testing with tuned hyperparameters.
13. Evaluation
14. Report
